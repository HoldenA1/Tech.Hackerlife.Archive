    <h1>Website</h1>
    <p>Believe it or not, this website was coded from scratch, by me, and is hosted on a raspberry pi in my living room. I utilized bootstrap to make my website look acceptable on any size display. I wanted to learn about networking, so I bought a domain name and started off on my long, long journey to get to this point.</p>

    <h3>Journey</h3>
    <div class="subheading">Idea</div>
      <p>I had this novel idea that I wanted a website. I also thought it would be cool to have it hosted on my mineral oil cooled computer, which you can learn more about <a href="../mineral_oil_pc">here</a>. Long story short, I set up a LAMP server to handle the hosting and bought a domain at <a href=https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>. It all worked relatively well, other than some overheating problems I had with the computer. That said, the website I put up was far from perfect, and more an inside joke with my friends. If you want to see it, go <a href="../../archive">here</a>, but do yourself a favor and don't click the link. About a year later, I saw that having my own website could be a great way to market my skills to employers. I took that opportunity to revamp my website and make it something that I could be proud of.</p>
    <div class="subheading">Hardware</div>
      <p>Bringing my website to a new level took more than just software. Although adequate for occasional use, the now 10 year old Dell tower was not in the greatest of shape. So I went with the next best thing, a Raspberry Pi. I began by setting up Raspbian with NGINX. I used <a href="https://www.pestmeester.nl/index.html#1.0">this</a> very helpful guide for reference. I chose to use NGINX instead of APACHE because of its focus on doing the most with minimal hardware like the raspberry pi.</p>
    <div class="subheading">Programming</div>
      <p>Although hardware was needed for the project, the main aspect of revamping my site was on the software side. Namely where to begin. I started by looking at well designed websites. I found a few that I liked the look of. <a href="http://www.fionayeung.com/">This</a> and <a href="https://jihoonsuh.com/">this</a> were my favorites and the main ones I based my design off of. I also had heard of <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> from a friend and decided to give it a try as well. From a mixture of trial and error, as well as sample code, I was able to make my template. With the template, I began to add content like the page you are reading right now. Overall, the design process was a fun and frustrating experience that I had never had before.</p>
    
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <div class="subheading">Navbar</div>
      <img src="../../photos/navbar.png" class="img-fluid d-inline" width="650px" style="padding-bottom:20px">
      <p>It just completes the look. I chose to put my logo on the bar, so wherever you go on the page, you can see it. At first I settled on a navbar that started lower on the page and stuck to the top as you scrolled past. I didn't like this design because it only looked good on my home page which had the nice header with my picture. I changed it to the static-top-bar so it could be consistent on every page, despite not having much functionality.</p>
    <div class="subheading">Project Pages</div>
      <img src="../../photos/projects.png" class="img-fluid d-inline" width="650px" style="padding-bottom:20px">
      <p>For these, I didn't just want to have a list of centered pictures with links. I got the idea to do a tile design from one of the websites I linked to above.</p>
    <div class="subheading">Footer</div>
      <img src="../../photos/footer.png" class="img-fluid d-inline" width="650px" style="padding-bottom:20px">
      <p>At first I contemplated putting my contact info on a section on the home page, but decided to put it in the footer so it would be on every page and easier to find. The copyright was a nice touch too.</p>
    <div class="subheading">Theme</div>
      <p>For the theme, I chose neutral colors mainly because they never look bad. Light and dark grey look much better than white and black, and have a little more class than a bunch of random colors. I chose to center everything in a small column because otherwise the page starts to feel crowded and unprofessional.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>The final product is what you see here and now. Hackerlife.tech is a constantly changing and evolving thing as it was since I began the project. I hope to come back to this project multiple times in my life to test out the new skills I have gained. But this is where it stands: a portfolio for my greatest achievements in tech.</p>
