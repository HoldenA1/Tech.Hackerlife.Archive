    <p>I have been programming as a hobby since seventh grade giving me four years total of experience with software. I have programmed in HTML, CSS, Javascript, C, Python, and -- probably the language I am most proficient in -- Java. In spring 2018, I took the AP Computer Science A test and got a 5. I have been on the Los Gatos High School robotics team, <a href="http://www.ironclaw972.org/">Iron Claw</a>, for two years now and currently hold the Teleop Programming position on the leadership team. On a regular basis I have to teach and manage a group of programmers working on the programming and code structure of our robot.
    </p>
    <p>In my freetime I like to explore other areas of computers. I have a passion for building interesting computers that complement my unique personality. A few of my PC builds are shown below, but getting down and dirty in the electrical and low level code is probably my favorite part of personal projects. This website is being hosted on a Raspberry Pi which I set up myself with nginx. In addition, I have visited two pcb assembly factories in China to learn more about how they manage their assembly lines and get production as cheap as possible. Technology is a large part of my life and I love spending all the time I have on it because I think it represents the greatest of all human accomplishment.
    </p>
    <p>I am also an avid traveler. I love traveling all over to experience different places and cultures. I've been to 16 different countries, over 25 states, and intend on going to many more places in the future. Traveling is something I really want to do a lot of and I already have an extensive list of places I'd like to visit. I am always looking for a new adventure and I can't wait to see which one awaits me next.
